(16, N'Names of the Guilty', N'The protagonist identifies the people responsible, but the evidence is dangerous to carry. Allies argue over whether justice is worth the likely cost.'),
(17, N'Last Quiet Hour', N'Before the final push, characters speak honestly. Romance, friendship, grief, or loyalty becomes explicit, giving the coming conflict emotional weight.'),
(18, N'Open Conflict', N'The hidden struggle becomes public. The protagonist confronts guards, rivals, machines, nobles, soldiers, spirits, or corporate agents in a scene built around action and consequence.'),
(19, N'The Choice', N'The protagonist reaches the decisive moral choice: revenge or mercy, secrecy or truth, escape or responsibility. The choice defines what kind of ending is possible.'),
